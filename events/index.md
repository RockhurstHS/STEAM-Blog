<div class="flex-wrapper">
  <img src="/img/BioNexusOneHealthKC.png">
</div> 
</center>

The [One Health Research Symposium: The Future of Health](https://bionexuskc.org/event/2020-one-health-research-symposium-biosensors/) on “biosensors and wearable sensors” will feature research showing the impact it is having in One Health (human, animal, and environmental health) applications. The use of biosensors in One Health applications has significant potential to enhance and accelerate the identification of disease conditions by providing access to real-time data to improve decision-making capabilities. 

<b>The event takes place during school hours, but students who register (it's free) for the event will receive a link with the recording.</b>

Rockhurst received a special code (Sensors) that provides a FREE all access pass to students. [Here](https://2020ohrs.eventbrite.com?discount=Sensors) is a shareable link: https://2020ohrs.eventbrite.com?discount=Sensors

Symposium highlights:

The keynote speaker, [Dr. Duncan Lascelles](https://bionexuskc.org/staff/b-duncan-x-lascelles-bsc-bvsc-phd-frcvs/) from NC State will showcase the challenges, opportunities, and future path forward via wearable and implantable sensors. These sensors offer opportunities to access continuous, real-time data across multiple varied dimensions. Such objective data collected in naturally occurring disease states in companion animals also offers a powerful comparative tool that can be leveraged to accelerate the development of analgesic therapies for human health. 

Additionally, on November 17, there will be a Career Panel Discussion with industry professionals from Hill’s Pet Nutrition, Merck Animal Health and Garmin. This will provide engagement opportunities and helpful insights for both students and researchers.

Burns & McDonnell is once again hosting their annual evening event ,YOUR WORLD: EMPOWERED, on TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2019 from 6:00 – 7:30PM at the Burns & McDonnell World Headquarters! 

At YOUR WORLD: EMPOWERED, they’ll answer questions such as, “So, what do engineers REALLY do?” and “Do I have to get perfect grades in order to have a career in the STEM fields?” and “Will I have to sit at a desk every day of my career if I’m an engineer?” They have a fun (and free!) program planned specifically designed to help students in grades 7 – 12 explore the possibilities of a career in engineering, architecture, drafting, environmental science and construction management. Their dynamic speaker will talk with students and parents about these different engineering career paths and dispel those crazy myths that surround these STEM fields! They will also have a panel of recent graduate STEM professionals ready to engage with the audience by offering tips for success in high school and college!
