	Beginning in 2016-2017, the academic schedule opened up to allow double-period labs. As a result, once a week students are in a science lab for 90 minutes. This allowed students to truly engage in more collaborative and inquiry-based learning experiences. Beyond the science classroom, the Advanced Filmmaking students worked with community organizations such as Operation Breakthrough, Morning Glory Cafe, and the STEAM Studio to create videos for them. The Introduction to Graphic Design and the Web Design classes improved the website and created marketing materials for 1861 Wealth Management. Furthermore, the Drawing & Design for Industry class constructed toy trucks to donate for children at Operation Breakthrough.
Incorporating more authentic problem solving and solution finding into the curriculum takes a giant leap forward in the 2017 - 2018 academic year. An Entrepreneurship for Others class will encourage students to apply what they are learning in real-world circumstances, enabling them to develop entrepreneurial attitudes, behaviors, and skills through utilizing an experiential, problem-based methodology. Culminating with an “Entrepreneurship for Others” (EfO) Pitch Night, open to the public, students will then present their learning canvas experiences and any associated products or services. In a similar effort, February 20, 2017 will feature Rockhurst’s very own MECA Challenge. 60 students broken up into 10 teams of 6 will be matched up with an alumni mentor to solve a problem in a rapid fire, one day event. Students will be presented a challenge in the morning and work until the afternoon where they will pitch their solution to a group of judges. The event will represent the type of innovative problem solving Rockhurst that engages students.
	The kick-off of the Fundamentals of Science Research course will also support students to engage in completing their very own authentic science research project. The fruits of this work will be the completion of a written report of the authentic project followed by a presentation of the experience and findings at the end of year Rockhurst Research Symposium.
	Beyond specific courses and class projects, Rockhurst utilizes seven Active Learning Classrooms. Six additional classrooms will be rolled out for the 2017-2018 academic year. These student-centered classrooms increase student engagement, comfort and class participation. Moreover, the classes create innovative opportunities for teachers both pedagogically and technologically. Most importantly, however, the active learning classrooms spark incredible amounts of collaboration, which help with relationship building.
