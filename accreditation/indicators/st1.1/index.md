Narrative
</p>
Rockhurst High School believes that all students can achieve success in STEM curriculum. Over the course of a six year period, the mathematics department transitioned from a restrictive AP Calculus program into an open enrollment opportunity for all students. In 2008, 65 students took either the AP Calculus AB or AP Calculus BC exam. However, the math department supported the [increased participation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjYgFLkaYyuNpJqJG4KTkZNaxPsWIP1Z6odTiIA-vAw/edit?usp=sharing) of students to 132 in 2015.

Students used to believe that only the smartest students as freshmen would be able to take AP Calculus. In fact, prior to opening up the AP Calculus program, the students who took the exam were often all coming from the same feeder schools that had exceptional sixth through eighth grade math students. Success in AP Calculus was not a function of innate, genetic ability, but really was determined with how well they were mathematically prepared before even entering Rockhurst. Now, the Rockhurst mathematics curriculum is much more vertically aligned to support all students and is now culminating in about half the senior class taking an AP Calculus Exam each year. Another consequence of the open curriculum has been the increased ACT Math scores for Rockhurst students from a 26 composite to a 27.1 composite.

When the Rockhurst High School STEAM initiative began in 2015, the STEAM team immediately identified a need for improvement within the computer science department. Previously, only the top students were taking computer science courses and none of those students were given the support to succeed on an Advanced Placement computer science exam. Beginning in 2016, every freshmen is taking a one semester [Introduction to Computer Science](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/07/01/Intro-to-CS-Down.html) course where they learn how to program with a language called Processing (an extension of Java) and JavaScript. With this course, we will set interested students up for more success in future AP Computer Science courses. We will also break down stereotypes by helping every student realize that learning computer science is an accessible skill for everyone.

At the start of the 2015 school year, Rockhurst kicked off its Robotics program. One freshmen class (Introduction to Robotics), and four junior/senior classes (Robotic Engineering I) began that helped 20% of the student body learn and implement the engineering design process. In conjunction with these classes, the [robotics team](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/08/20/Reflections-of-a-Jesubot.html) competed in the FIRST robotics competition. In 2017-2018, the Principles of Engineering (POE) course administered through Project Lead the Way (PLTW) will introduce even more students to the engineering design process.
  
Beyond these courses, which are open to all students, Rockhurst has several programs that are targeting at-risk students and helping them with STEM curriculum. First of all, the [Hurtado Scholars program](https://www.rockhursths.edu/pages/about-us/about-us---hurtado-scholars-program) identifies at-risk sixth graders at three urban Catholic schools. Between eight and twelve students are accepted each year. These students receive bi-weekly tutoring from Rockhurst math and English teachers. The students also engage in a five week summer school program, which emphasizes STEM curriculum in multiple ways. The students take both a problem-based math class and an applied math class. They also learn about the engineering design process with a robotics component. The very first group of Hurtado Scholars all got into Rockhurst High School this year and every single one of them found academic success.

All students take a High School Placement Test. For the lowest performing students, Rockhurst requires them to attend a four week summer school program. This program includes a rigorous math class that teaches them everything they need to know in order to be successful on the first day of Algebra 1. Of the summer school group, the lowest group that is still admitted into the school enter our Magis Academy program. These students take a specialized math class their freshman and sophomore year that coincides with a study skills class. These students are then mainstreamed into the standard mathematics curriculum during their junior year. Very few of the 250 - 300 student applicants each year are declined acceptance into Rockhurst before given the opportunity to access the previous support pathways. 
  
This year the STEAM initiative partnered with [MindDrive](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/09/01/MindDrive.html). Two Rockhurst students are now spending 27 consecutive Saturdays 3D printing and programming an autonomous car! The STEAM initiative also organized student volunteers to work with younger students at the [STEAM Studio](http://steam-studio.com/). This service learning opportunity helps provide non-traditional students outside of Rockhurst access to STEM curriculum. It also introduces some of our “non-STEM” students to STEM curriculum through the lens of volunteering.

Finally, some of our students can’t find a pathway to fit in all of their interests. Many want to pursue STEM education, but have to choose between science and history (for example). In order to provide more access to STEM classes, Rockhurst began a [Summer Academy](https://www.rockhursths.edu/pages/academics/summer-school-and-camps/academics---summer-school---high-school-credit-courses) in the summer of 2016. This allows students to take a full year of Chemistry in a six-week intensive. This helps students get ahead in STEM coursework, but it also helps students pursue multiple academic interests so they don’t have to make a choice early in their lives that will impact their entire academic future.
