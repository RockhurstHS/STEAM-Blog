##Who I am…

I am passionate about Ignatian Education, Mathematics, Neuro-Education & Learning Science, and Juggling. A member of the great class of 2000, I started teaching summer school mathematics when I was 19 and am now entering my eleventh year as a full-time Ignatian educator. Before taking the position of Rockhurst STEAM director, I was the chair of the Mathematics department for six years. I’ve taught nearly every course in the Rockhurst curriculum, but spent most of my time teaching AP Calculus I and II.  

Beyond the classroom I spent four years as a freshmen basketball coach, ten years as a chess team coach (including four state titles) and eleven years as the juggling club moderator.  Additionally, I direct one Kairos retreat each year. 

##My academic philosophy…

My basic philosophy of education results from my assumption that every human being has an innate desire to learn.  I strive to stimulate that innate desire. When I evaluate and assess learning in the classroom, Ignatian spirituality mandates that I take into account the whole person. My role as an educator is not simply to facilitate a learning environment that brings out a love of knowledge, but also brings out the best within each person.  God desires each student to be who he or she was created to be.

The word education relates to the Latin word ‘educere’, which means ‘to bring out’.  Philosophy comes from ‘philos’, or ‘loving’, and ‘sophia’, equating to ‘knowledge’.  Therefore, an educational philosophy implies caring to bring out a love of knowledge. However, my educational philosophy is richer than the etymology that the words imply. My educational philosophy encourages more than a love of knowledge, but a love of striving for the magis. Perhaps this is the difference between a teacher and an Ignatian educator. 

And to respond to Mr. Winkeler's educational philosophy, I defer to the following [comic](https://xkcd.com/435/)

##My dream classroom…

A dream room for my students is a living, moving, empowering space that optimizes their learning. [Mark Twain](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1427-i-have-never-let-my-schooling-interfere-with-my-education) asserted “I never let my schooling get in the way of my education”.  In this way, the space enhances the learning experience by activating the students’ imagination and their love of learning.
