##Who I am…

I am passionate about Ignatian Education, Mathematics, Neuro-Education & Learning Science, and Juggling. A member of the great class of 2000, I started teaching summer school mathematics when I was 19 and am now entering my eleventh year as a full-time Ignatian educator. Before taking the position of Rockhurst STEAM director, I was the chair of the Mathematics department for six years. I’ve taught nearly every course in the Rockhurst curriculum, but spent most of my time teaching AP Calculus I and II.  

Beyond the classroom I spent four years as a freshmen basketball coach, ten years as a chess team coach (including four state titles) and eleven years as the juggling club moderator.  Additionally, I direct one Kairos retreat each year.
