##Who I amâ€¦

I teach Robotics engineering and Introduction to Robotics Engineering. I am a 26 year veteran biology teacher and tinkerer/maker. 

##My academic philosophy

Students learn best by doing - in the lab, in the shop. When possible, all teaching should be done this way.

##My dream classroom

Cabinets, Whiteboards, and tools, lots of each. Cabinets for storage and organization. Whiteboards for communication/iteration. Tools to build things. 

##My STEAM goals

To teach the young men the vaules of St. Ignatius while using robotics as a platform to do so.
