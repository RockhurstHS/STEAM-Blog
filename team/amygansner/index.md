## Who I am...

I have been at Rockhurst since 2010 and am the Library Media Specialist. I graduated from Rockhurst University with a major in English and Secondary Education and from Pittsburg State University with a master's degree in Educational Technology and Library Media. In addition to loving my role here at Rockhurst, I am a wife, sister, daughter, friend, and mother to five lovely children. In my spare time, you might find me gardening, baking, reading or running slowly. 

## My learning philosophy...

I believe we all have a tremendous natural curiosity and ability to learn. Through curiosity, exploration, investigation, and experimentation, we all have the capability to discover the things we are passionate about doing. I think learning should be joyful and reflective.

## My dream library space...

A comfortable, inviting, creative space with various areas and support for students to work according to their individual needs and learning style. . .Oh wait, have you seen our new Learning Commons??!!

## My STEAM Goals...

My goal is for students to be actively engaged in their learning experience through exploration, research, technology, and innovation.
