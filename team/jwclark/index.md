##Tell us about you

How far back shall I go? I moved to Kansas City when I was five to attend kindergarten. I grew up on Red Bridge Road in South Kansas City and attended Red Bridge Elementary school in the Center School District. I attended middle school at St. Thomas More. I'm a Cyclone! From there I attended Rockhurst High School from 1996 - 2000. That's right, class of 2000. I'm a millenial in the truest sense.

For the last five years I worked as a systems admin in Rockhurst High School's IT office, serving on the front line of daily technical support for the entire organization. In the process of offering my support I had the opportunity to develop a good working relationship with nearly everybody.

This year I transition to full time faculty as I begin planning the future of computer science curriculum at Rockhurst High School.
