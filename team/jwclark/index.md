##Who I am...

How far back shall I go? I grew up in South Kansas City as a Red Bridge Road Runner, finished middle school as a St. Thomas More Cyclone, high school as a Rockhurst Hawklet class of 2000. Millenial in that sense. All the while, I spent 13 summers growing up along Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore in Michigan. Three of those summers I taught river and lake canoeing, outdoor survival skills, and led youth camping trips into Northern Michigan and Ontario. While finishing college I was a volunteer 7th and 8th grade math teacher at Hartman Elementary school. I now run summer programming camps at Rockhurst High School and will pick up where John McEniry left off with teaching computer science to the high school students.

I hold the following degrees: B.A. Interpersonal Communication and Public Relations (UMKC), B.S. Computer Information Systems (DeVry), and M.S. Computer Science (UMKC). While I focus on software engineering and big data processing, I have extreme interest in machine learning and hope to bring some of it to the students at Rockhurst High School.

##My academic philosophy...

In any task academic or professional, submit all work, do best effort, meet all deadlines. Step up and be a leader. Identify the needs of others. Provide the tools they need to succeed. Keep an open channel and work to accomodate others so they may deliver based on their strengths. 

##My dream classroom...

Outdoors! But hey, computers can't really "weather the elements" so let's go with teams of four: standing Steelcase desks with 1:1 whiteboard cards, no chairs, 1:1 17" Macbook Pros, 1:4 4K Televisions. A server rack in the corner, student administered. Remove the ceiling tiles and scaffolding. White boards on spare walls. Enough electricity to power students in any formation. Oh - and Segways. One per teacher.

##My STEAM goals...

As a fisherman of intellect, I want to cast a wide net in this city. First, I want to reel in all of the student interest at Rockhurst High School. Then, I want to broadem our reach to the community. I envision students filling internships and satisfying community service obligations by offering their stem skills to organizations in need. I hope to bring computer science to grade schools so that our future students are prepared to go further. I believe this is a city with a high tech ceiling and in general has a lot of potential to bridge the technical skills gap in schools, city-wide. To do so requires making a lot of connections, having a lot of conversations. The interest is certainly there.
