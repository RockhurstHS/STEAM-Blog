##Who I am...

How far back shall I go? I grew up in South Kansas City as a Red Bridge Road Runner, finished middle school as a St. Thomas More Cyclone, high school as a Rockhurst Hawklet class of 2000. Millenial in the truest sense. All the while, I spent 13 summers along Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore in Michigan. Three of those summers I taught river and lake canoeing, outdoor survival skills, and led youth camping trips into Northern Michigan and Ontario. While finishing college I was a volunteer 7th and 8th grade math teacher at Hartman Elementary school.

I hold a degree in Communication Studies from UMKC, a degree in Computer Information Systems from DeVry University, and I expect to complete a Master of Science in Computer Science at UMKC this December. I focus on software engineering and big data. I have extreme interest in machine learning and hope to bring some of it to the students at Rockhurst High School.

For the last five years I worked as a systems admin in Rockhurst High School's IT office, serving on the front line of daily technical support for the entire organization. In the process of offering my support I had the opportunity to develop a good working relationship with nearly everybody.

This year I transition to faculty as I begin planning the future of computer science curriculum at Rockhurst High School. And let me tell you - I am excited.

##My academic philosophy...

In any task academic or professional, submit all work, do best effort, meet all deadlines. Step up and be a leader. Identify the needs of others. Provide the tools they need to succeed. Keep an open channel and work to accomodate others so they may deliver based on their strengths.

##My dream classroom...

Outdoors! But hey, computers can't really "weather the elements" so let's go with teams of four: standing Steelcase desks with 1:1 whiteboard cards, no chairs, 1:1 17" Macbook Pros, 1:4 4K Televisions. A server rack in the corner, student administered. Remove the ceiling tiles and scaffolding. White boards on spare walls. Enough electricity to power students in any formation. Oh - and Segways. One per teacher.
