# What is Active Learning?

<blockquote>“A big problem is that traditional learning experiences are not aligned with how the brain works, particularly as it relates to attention.”
<br><strong> - Andrew Kim, Education Researcher at Steelcase</strong></blockquote>


Active Learning is a new educational mindset. [Steelcase Education is a major player in influencing the future of education.](https://www.steelcase.com/spaces-inspiration/active-learning-spaces-classrooms/#research-insights_observations) The goal of learning is for students to be the actors of their learning. They need to be engaged! Learning doesn’t happen through osmosis as Socrates articulated in Plato’s dialogue, [The Symposium](http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/symposium.txt).

How do we redesign classroom space?  
How do we adjust our pedagogy?


Rockhurst High School’s mission is to form “men with and for others” who are intellectually competent, religious, committed to justice, open to growth and loving. During instruction time, how can a school help its students improve their ability to be open to growth and loving? The STEAM initiative believes students need to actively [interact more with each other](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2015/09/07/Three-Weeks-In.html). We want to leverage the strong brotherhood that exists at Rockhurst and get the students to engage with one another more frequently during instruction time. 


We took away the ‘front of the classroom’. The classes are shifting from being teacher-centered to student-centered. The role of the teacher is changing from being a [‘sage on the stage’ to the ‘guide on the side’](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/04/11/Sage-on-the-stage-to-Guide-on-the-Side.html). Students sit in groups of four. We have one projector and two tv screens that create a digital triangle around the room. Therefore, students can see what the teacher is projecting no matter where they are sitting. The chairs swivel so that students may more easily look each other in the eye while speaking. Individual white boards [help introverted students participate in class](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2015/09/17/Reflecting-on-Student-Whiteboards.html) and also serve as barriers during assessment time. If we truly want students to become more open to growth and more loving, then we believe that the majority of a student’s day at our school (instruction time) should be in an environment such that students engage with the relationships they have in one another. [So far, the results have been good](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/05/09/Perceptions-of-the-Active-Learning-Classrooms.html). This project will help us further fulfill our [vision and mission as a school](https://www.rockhursths.edu/pages/about-us/school-information/about-us---school-information---mission-and-vision).
