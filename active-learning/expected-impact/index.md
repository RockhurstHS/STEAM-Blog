title: Expected Impact
---

Will consistent exposure to an Active Learning environment impact a student’s mindset? Will it help them develop a sense of agency where they can better exhibit self-control habits? The goal of the Active Learning is not simply to raise the grades of students (although that is a desired goal). Ultimately, the desire is to determine the ability of Active Learning to positively impact other skills such as the [growth mindset](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftSBJiFZj2xel0WvwVQAEFHe7v8DVZ1BKFivoKA1nW3NFp1g/viewform) and [self-control](https://docs.google.com/a/rockhursths.edu/forms/d/1W-JpSzFJtithgD_Nwx_zRimdfsAj014MCKd71E2RcPI/edit) of students. Indeed, there are [research based practices](https://www.edutopia.org/article/growth-mindset-resources) that teachers utilize to address mindsets.Ultimately, Rockhurst High School wants all students to have a strong sense of agency - the ability to identify a goal and then proactively take the necessary steps to achieve that goal. Engaging in active learning will be perceived as an improved learning experience for the students. [Evidence]{http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/05/09/Perceptions-of-the-Active-Learning-Classrooms.html} already points that this expected impact is true. 

Part of the Rockhurst vision is to be an educational leader in the community, a ‘school for others’. We already try to serve the larger educational community by sharing our learning with others. As a private institution, we are agile. We are committed to sharing what we learn with all other educational institutions so that they may make the best high-impact decisions for their students, especially the most at-risk students who need a more individualized and active learning approach to empower their learning.
