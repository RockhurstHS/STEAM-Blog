title: Expected Impact
---

Will consistent exposure to an Active Learning environment impact a student’s mindset? Will it help them develop a sense of agency where they can better exhibit self-control habits? The goal of the Active Learning is not simply to raise the grades of students (although that is a desired goal). Ultimately, the desire is to determine the ability of Active Learning to positively impact other skills such as the growth mindset and self-control of students. Ultimately, Rockhurst High School wants all students to have a strong sense of agency - the ability to identify a goal and then proactively take the necessary steps to achieve that goal.

Part of the Rockhurst vision is to be an educational leader in the community, a ‘school for others’. We already try to serve the larger educational community by sharing our learning with others. As a private institution, we are agile. We are committed to sharing what we learn with all other educational institutions so that they may make the best high-impact decisions for their students, especially the most at-risk students who need a more individualized and active learning approach to empower their learning.
