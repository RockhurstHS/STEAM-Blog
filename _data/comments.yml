This is fascinating and holy work.\r\nI am so blessed to have worked with the likes of you two. Selfishly, and wish my grandchildren could all be taught to learn this way. I am sending prayers for the road ahead, and of thanksgiving for all your group has completed.\r\nGod Bless and God Speed\r\n", created: '2015-09-18T02:13:43.686Z', email: Gerrisopyla@hotmail.com, name: 'G Sopyla', path: /2015/07/14/Whats-STEAMing.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/55d225b7c5c58d38c938452690de9a1c?s=50&r=pg&d=mm'}
