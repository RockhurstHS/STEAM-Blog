Building upon the success of [last year’s class](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2018/06/01/Principles-of-Engineering.html), Rockhurst students are still enjoying the Principles of Engineering class taught by the habile [Mr. Wilson](https://www.moondropcircus.com/current/). The project based learning course engages students with various projects. For example, in the fall [students helped build a Captain America wheelchair costume for an 11 year old with cerebral palsy.](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2018/11/01/Walkin-and-Rollin-Costumes.html)

Principles of Engineering (POE) curriculum is developed by Project Lead the Way (PLTW), which has partnered with AP College Board. Students who score high on the end of course exam in POE as well as score high on specific AP courses are awarded an [AP+PLTW student recognition](https://www.pltw.org/our-programs/ap-pltw). 

The course content is summarized on the PLTW website as the following: 

<b>Through problems that engage and challenge, students explore a broad range of engineering topics, including mechanisms, the strength of structures and materials, and automation, tudents develop skills in problem solving, research, and design while learning strategies for design process documentation, collaboration, and presentation.</b>

<blockquote>“Today's an exciting day, we're testing trusses! Students have painstakingly crafted trusses out of balsa wood, and a VEX testing device. Today they finally get to destroy all of their hard work. I'll have students document their testing with video.” - Mr. Wilson</blockquote>
