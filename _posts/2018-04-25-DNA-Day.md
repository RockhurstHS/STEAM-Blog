<blockquote>April 25th is known and annually celebrated as "DNA Day".</blockquote>

On April 25th, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick first published their discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA in the journal <i>Nature</i>. This discovery, for which they would later win the Nobel Prize, opened the door for numerous ground-breaking advances in the field of science. 

April 25th is known and annually celebrated as "DNA Day".

To celebrate DNA Day at Rockhurst High School, the students of freshmen biology classes designed and built models of DNA. Some of the models can be seen now in the second floor display case in honor of this special day in history.

Also displayed is a picture of British Physicist Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction, which was the key that gave Watson & Crick the ability to unlock the helical structure of DNA.
