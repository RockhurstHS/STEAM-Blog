On April 19th, Ms. Unice Harris came to share some project management skills to students. About two dozen students attended the activity period presentation in the pitch space. Afterwards, many students commented about how applicable these skills can be in their own lives, whether it be with club projects, class projects or simply staying organized from day to day.

Ms. Harris shared with the students the value a project manager can bring to an organization. Students started thinking about project management as a possible career path. Some of the students in attendance remarked how they witnessed these skills when they participated in the [JE Dunn Mentoring Program](https://www.rockhursths.edu/pages/news/news---je-dunn-mentorship).

<blockquote><i>Project management skills are life skills that any young man will need throughout his life.  The skill is needed to prepare them to manage households as they grow into men, to plan classes etc for a successful college experience as well as everyday events right now. - Ms. Harris</i></blockquote>

Project management is becoming a [more and more popular career path](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/business-solutions/project-management-skills-gap-report.pdf). The STEAM initiative at Rockhurst is thinking about how to cultivate student project management skills as part of their high school experience. 

Ms. Harris is a professional project manager and current Rockhurst parent. She also volunteered at Rockhurst when the school hosted the [regional STEM Conference](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2018/03/15/AdvancED-STEM-Conference.html).
