A growing trend in education right now involves submerging students into an authentic, real-world challenge and seeing what they can do. 

These challenges live in the intersection space between full blown [robotics competition](https://www.rockhursths.edu/pages/news/news---robotics-world-championship-qualifiers) and a [hackathon](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2015/11/10/High-School-Programming-Competition.html).

46 students participated in the entrepreneural event called the [MECA Challenge](https://pnonline.org/2017/03/05/building-an-innovative-mindset/).
