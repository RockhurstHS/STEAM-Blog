The math department hosted 19 middle school math teachers, on November 13th.  The day was an opportunity to meet them and to collaborate and exchange ideas.  Our invitations were met with a lot of excitement, and that made the day easy to put together.

Our group of 19 teachers were looking forward to the day, and were ready to take part in whatever activities we had planned.  We talked about adopting a new view of intelligence, how to foster a growth mindset, computer programs/websites to create worksheets, and our math curricula.  Along with this, our visitors got to take a quick tour of our building, and eat in our Dining Commons.

All in all, I enjoyed hosting this event, and, more importantly, our guests enjoyed taking part.  I think this was an awesome first step in developing relationships that will, in the long run, benefit our students.
