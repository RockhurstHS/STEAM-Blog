But many, like Ryan Ficklin, take a liking to it &amp; plan on continuing their CS education. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSEdWeekKC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CSEdWeekKC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/KCTechCouncil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KCTechCouncil</a> AMDG <a href="https://t.co/KiaakygizD">pic.twitter.com/KiaakygizD</a></p>&mdash; Rockhurst HS (@RockhurstHS) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockhurstHS/status/1070068704845524992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2018</a></blockquote>
