## MindDrive

The STEAM initiative is thrilled to help two Rockhurst students participate in the 2016-2017 [MindDrive](http://minddrive.org/) class. These students are committing themselves to 27 Saturdays from 9am - 1pm. Through hands on, project-based learning, the students will be 3D printing an autonomous car! Stay tuned for a progress report blog post to come!
