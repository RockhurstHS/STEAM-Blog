Participating in [STEAM Studio](http://steam-studio.com/) and [ISTE](https://conference.iste.org/2017/0 have been very enjoyable parts of my Rockhurst career. Participating in STEAM Studio has given me the opportunity to do meaningful things in the community while also learning and doing something I am passionate about. I am very passionate about technology and STEAM has been a great outlet. Participating in the STEAM Studio has also allowed me to branch out and connect with other tech firms such as Cerner and Tesla.

Going to the ISTE Trip was also a fun trip because I got to go to cities in the U.S. that I had never been to and get introduced to many companies and corporations that I had not previously been aware of. It opened my eye to a lot of the innovation that is happening in the education technology field and get a preview of what the "[Classroom of the Future](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/active-learning/classroom-description/)" might look like.
