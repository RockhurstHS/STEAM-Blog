Students from the Entrepreneurship for Others (EFO) class pitched their business canvas solutions on Wednesday, December 12th, 2018. In front of a panel of judges and over 100 guests including parents, faculty and alumni, the students showcased their prototypes and research they developed over the course of their semester course.

Each student led company had 5 minutes to pitch their product or service. Afterwards, the panel of judges had 5 additional minutes for questions. The class is in its 2nd year with a goal of allowing the young men to get creative, work in teams, research, pitch, grow and potentially fail. The fall of 2018 semester produced 8 student teams that tackled a variety of issues that the students felt were important.

  <li><b>RecBooth</b> - portable, cost effective recording/event software.</li>
  <li><b>Educomm</b> - school teacher/administration communication tool to help timing of homework and tests across the entire school.</li>

Providing an authentic audience for the students is a growing point of emphasis for the Rockhurst learning experience. Indicator [1.11 of the STEM Certification](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/stem-certification/indicators/st1.11/) emphasizes the importance of relative adult-world connections in supporting student learning. The EFO class created multiple opportunities for students to interact with adults.
