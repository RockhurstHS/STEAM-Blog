Rockhurst High School was excited to partner with [STEAM Stars](https://www.sciencestars17.com/) this summer, a FUN science camp for youth. One huge barrier for future scientists is an individual's belief that they don't like science and/or they are not good at it. STEAM Stars is an excellent program that empowers our future scientists! See for yourself!

WE are hopeful to offer future STEAM Stars events in the future.
