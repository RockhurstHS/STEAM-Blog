The Rockhurst Outdoors Club represents STEAM by presenting students with the opportunity to experience flight at iFLY. For those unfamiliar with the iFLY, it is an indoor skydiving facility located in Overland Park, KS.

Rockhurst students participated in a STEAM Course which focused on the technology that went into designing the wind tunnel as well as further instruction on the science involved in the experience.
