The family of senior Grady Schmitz had some electrical problems with their fishing boat. Sounds like a great project for the Robotics & Engineering 2 class!

The class happened to be studying electricity & electronics. They took notes on electrical schematics, tested and repaired the wiring on the boat and finally succeeded in getting the lights to function. They used multimeters to check voltage and current flow (amps). With those measurements, they had the “road map” to repair the wiring.

The Schmitz family is back to fishing with their boat again!
