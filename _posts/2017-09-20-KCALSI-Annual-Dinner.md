During the presentation given at the [dinner](http://kclifesciences.org/events/previous-kcalsi-events/annual-dinner/), I found many things to be incredibly inspiring and motivational. As I have grown up, my ideas of where we are today with regards to science were thought to have been more archaic than reality has most recently stated; I was ignorant. After witnessing that presentation, now I can truly say that I am glad to be alive at this particular time in human history. I say this because I have always wanted to be a scientific researcher, and it excites me to see the plethora of newfound studies. Seeing the new studies has moved me to try and see what else could be accomplishedâ€“ to want to strive for more possibilities. It has instilled within me even more of a motivation to do [research](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2017/02/01/New-Courses.html) and therefore to find potentially better options in order to better the lives of other human beings.
