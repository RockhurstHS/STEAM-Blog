First, I would like to thank Rochurst for helping me conduct my science experiment, I couldn’t have done it without them. About a month and a half ago, I had finished the writing portion of my science experiment. I had decided to model the expansion of liquid nitrogen, and I would conduct my experiment by filling ping pong balls with liquid nitrogen, and seeing if they would spin, and how fast. First, we considered making our own liquid nitrogen and realized that it can be dangerous. We looked into buying the liquid nitrogen, but nobody would sell it to us without the dewar (A safe container for liquid nitrogen). That is when my Mom reached out to Rockhurst High School. They were so helpful, not only in obtaining the liquid nitrogen and the dewar, but also, in helping me conduct my experiment. They taught me some things about the properties of liquid nitrogen that I hadn’t heard of through my weeks of research. We were able to experiment with other variables than just the ones originally included in my experiment. It was by far the most enjoyment I have ever gotten out of a school project. Again, a big thank you to Rockhurst High School for helping me out, I couldn’t have done it without their help.

Sincerely, Olivier Desbois,
Indian Hills Middle School
