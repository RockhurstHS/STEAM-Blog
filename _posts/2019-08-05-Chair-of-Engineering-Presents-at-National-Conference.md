This past July, Computer Science and Engineering Department Chair, [Andy Wilcox](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/team/andywilcox/) presented at the NSTA (National Science Teaching Association) STEM Expo in San Francisco, California. The topic of his presentation was “How to Create and Maintain a Successful Robotics Program.”  During his presentation he gave a synopsis of how Rockhurst began and continues to develop its robotics program.

He included in his talk about the initial meetings in the 2013-2014 school on the creation of a robotics team and how the interest in competitive robotics led to the creation of three robotics classes.  He also cited examples of real world problem solving as the Robotics Engineering 2 students rewired a fishing boat and designed and built an ROV for their unit on electronics.

In addition to presenting at the Expo, he attended many seminars on how to create/cultivate community partnerships to provide intern/externships for the students. Strong mentors who buy into the Jesubots culture are a key ingredient for the success of the students, as mentioned in the STEAM student bio of [Andrew Meyer '19](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2019/04/30/Jesubot-Entrepreneurship-Award.html). The mentor motto of the Jesubots is: "Teach them, lead them, let them."
