Students in the Introduction to Filmmaking course embarked on a Green Screen Demo project this quarter. The Communication Arts Department Chair and course instructor, [Ms. Nicole Smith](https://www.rockhursths.edu/curriculum-detail?fromId=275451&LevelNum=1736&DepartmentId=30082), teaches her students skills that empowered them to unleash their creativity. After using the green screen in one of Rockhurst maker space areas, students use Adobe Premeire Pro to create their demos. Students learned skills like converting files to .mp4s and how to actually key a green screen.  

Each student group decided on a background with an appropriate action. Their video had a time limit of 30 seconds.  The purpose of this assignment was to provide the students the option of using a green screen in future projects.  The student group's team logo also had to be included.
