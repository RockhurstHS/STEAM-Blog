title: Looking at STEM through an Ignatian Lens
excerpt: As an Ignatian school, we already fulfill the requirements of a STEM school.
---

I believe we are a profoundly Ignatian school and, as such, fulfill the [standards of a STEM school](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/04/25/STEM-Certification.html). Furthermore, our mission as a school is to form “Men with and for Others”. Rockhurst models this behavior by being a “School with and for Others”. This means that Rockhurst High School reflects upon experiences and shares those best practices with other educational institutions. 

On March 2nd, I shared how Rockhurst approaches STEM through an Ignatian Lens during an online webinar for the [Jesuit Schools Network (JSN)](https://www.jesuitschoolsnetwork.org/), which is comprised of about 80 schools from around the United States, Central America and beyond.
