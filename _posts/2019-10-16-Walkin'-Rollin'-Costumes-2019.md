<blockquote>“Seeing Zoe that happy when we presented her with the carriage was a great feeling” - David King ’20.</blockquote>

For the 3rd straight year, Rockhurst High School students have collaborated with [Walkin' & Rollin' Costumes](https://www.walkinrollin.org/). This year, however, the project was incorporated into a class and the students of Rockhurst High School were able to construct two different costumes for wheelchair bound students. Senior David King reflected, “Our group spent a lot of time designing, measuring and constructing and we’re proud that she liked it."

Walkin' & Rollin' is a local NonProfit that states, "Every child deserves a cool costume. Sometimes, though, that's a little more challenging, especially for those in walkers and wheelchairs. That's why Walkin' & Rollin' Costumes was born: to be able to create something truly unique and custom-made for these special kids...somthing that's free of charge to the family."


As members of a Catholic, Jesuit school, students in the Robotics and Engineering II course learn the engineering design process while also demonstrating empathy through service. The Universal Apostolic Preferences of the Society of Jesus include "Walking with the Excluded". On their [webpage](https://jesuits.global/en/uap/walking-with-the-excluded), we are reminded that "Jesus suffers and is crucified in and with His people, especially the little ones. He takes the hands of the excluded, abused and vulnerable. He says to them “Come, inherit the Kingdom”. We are all God’s children."

On Saturday, October 12th, all the children and partner organizations gathered for a giant [reveal party] (https://www.walkinrollin.org/twisted-halloween-2019.html)
