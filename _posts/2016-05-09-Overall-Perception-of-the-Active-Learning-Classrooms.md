title: Overall Perception of the Active Learning Classrooms

The survey results for our 2nd Active Learning Classroom Survey convey so much insight! Just like the last survey, the perception data is overwhelmingly positive.


The survey included the following short answer prompt: 


>**How do you feel the new classroom has impacted your learning experience?**


Here are two of my favorite quotes:


>“I feel that the new active learning classroom has helped me in a big way.  It is a lot easier to learn and pay attention to people who are speaking and easier to get feedback from other students.”



>“More people pay attention. I hardly ever see anyone playing games, or messing around with their iPad. It's just so much easier to pay attention and participate and removes 90% or the boringness of a normal classroom. I think these classrooms are extremely useful to everyone, students and teachers alike, and truly do live up to their name as active learning classrooms. I love these classrooms and hope that they do get implemented for future Rockhurst students."


Using the qualitative data analysis software, Atlas.ti, here are some of the common themes:

And some of those themes relate to each other! 20% of the time students discuss improved attention, they are also saying that the learning is easier.


Most of the survey required students to respond to the following likert scale:

The following question intrigued me:

**Does a relationship exist between the average scores and the short answer responses?**


While playing with Tableau, I produced the following image:

The columns in the picture display 4 of the 252 Active Learning Classroom survey responses.The horizontal line represents the average rating students gave to all questions (4.365 on a 5 point scale), while the smaller lines represent the averages of that particular respondent (4.2, 5, 4.8, and 4.111 respectively in the image above).


This image gave me an idea. If we separated the survey respondents into two groups, those that had individual averages above the group average and those whose averages fell below the overall average, then what would we discover?


The top 15 words of the bottom half are on the left.  The top 15 words of the top half group are on the right.

Hmm...so many words are the same.  What if we crossed out all of the words in common?

Remaining words in the bottom half: 

>**“Really work better”**

Remaining words in the top half:

>**“Comfortable around room”**


What’s the moral of this story? All students prefer the Active Learning Classrooms. Only 2 out of 252 students had an average rating below a 3 out of 5. Therefore 250 of the 252 students rated the Active Learning Classrooms as creating in improved learning experience. Overall, the average was a 4.365; thus, somewhere between ‘a little easier’ and ‘a lot easier’. 


The students who rated questions the highest seem to articulate that the comfort is the greatest factor. The bottom half simply state that the room is an improvement. Overall, I believe that we can conclude that the Active Learning Classrooms improved the learning experience of our students this year.



How has the perception changed since the beginning of the year?  No. All changes were negligible.  See for yourself:

The positive perceptions of the Active Learning Classrooms remained consistent over the year.
