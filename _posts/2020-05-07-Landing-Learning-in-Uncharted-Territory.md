Incorporating capstone projects to punctuate a course contribute an added benefit of flexibility and agility for teachers and students. When Rockhurst High School went to an online learning model due to the worldwide pandemic, Mr. Paul Winkeler’s Astronomy students were able to stay engaged and continue their learning journey. While everyone was figuring out their new normal for the spring semester, Mr. Winkeler also talked about how the course’s final project help his course maintain high expectations and high standards for both him as the instructor and the students.

## See below for a brief summary of the project itself.

One aspect of Mr,. Winkeler’s design is the incorporation of student roles. This structure helps when it comes to students receiving individual grades and being held accountable for individual work. Sometimes it is hard for a teacher to give different grades to students in the same group; however, incorporating student roles assists in solving this dilemma.

In the past, I’ve heard Mr. Winkeler share critical insights about the distinction between high integrity learning projects and what he affectionately calls, “edu-tainment”. So I asked him a question along those lines: “What’s the evidence for learning?”

If you are considering incorporating a project into your course, then listen to Mr. Winkeler’s advice on how to proceed.
