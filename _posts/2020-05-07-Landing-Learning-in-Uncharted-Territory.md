title: Course Projects - Landing Learning in Uncharted Territory.

Incorporating capstone projects to punctuate a course contribute an added benefit of flexibility and agility for teachers and students. When Rockhurst High School went to an online learning model due to the worldwide pandemic, Mr. Paul Winkeler’s Astronomy students were able to stay engaged and continue their learning journey. While everyone was figuring out their new normal for the spring semester, Mr. Winkeler, Chair of the Science Department. also talked about how the course’s final project help his course maintain high expectations and high standards for both him as the instructor and the students.

## Importance of a project

<blockquote> "One of the things that I noticed the most was how 'into' this [the project] they were." </blockquote>

## See below for a brief summary of the project itself.

## Project Summary

<blockquote> "The final project for the Astronomy class is deeply rooted in the entire class." </blockquote>

One aspect of Mr,. Winkeler’s design is the incorporation of student roles. This structure helps when it comes to students receiving individual grades and being held accountable for individual work. Sometimes it is hard for a teacher to give different grades to students in the same group; however, incorporating student roles assists in solving this dilemma. 

## Project Roles

<blockquote< "They all have to really work together. At the same time, they each get their own individual grade." </blockquote>

In the past, I’ve heard Mr. Winkeler share critical insights about the distinction between high integrity learning projects and what he affectionately calls, “edu-tainment”. So I asked him a question along those lines: “What’s the evidence for learning?”

## Learning Evidence

<blockquote> "I tell students that if they want to go to Titan, then they will be expected to be the expert in the room when it comes to Titan." </blockquote>

<blockquote> "One of the big questions is, "Why?" Tell me what got you into this and why you want to go to Neptune, or whereever it is." </blockquote>
If you are considering incorporating a project into your course, then listen to Mr. Winkeler’s advice on how to proceed.

## Advice

<blockquote> "List out as much as you can and post it." </blockquote>
