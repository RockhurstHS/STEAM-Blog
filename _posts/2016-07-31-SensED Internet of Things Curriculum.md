When Greg Owsley asked me if I wanted to enroll in the SensED IoT workshop at the end of July, I was reluctant to give up 30 hours of my free time at the end of summer vacation. Just one week earlier, I was attending the AP Computer Science A workshop in Palo Alto thinking of excuses that could get me dismissed from the SensED workshop. I decided not to flake out and rather give it a chance.

To my delight, the SensED IoT workshop was attended by a small number of teachers, was hosted by not one but two workshop organizers, and featured a variety of interesting and relevant guest speakers. Moreover, it was beneficial to my upcoming academic year and armed me with a collection of materials that I will likely use to support my instruction of the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework.


I am eager to drop this curriculum framework into the AP Computer Science Principles course and see if we can't get some prototypes developed by the students for the Innovation Challenge. Furthermore, I would really like to see a division of the challenge grow to encompass local area private schools. There's nothing I have against competing with the public schools, but the reality is that space is limited at ThinkBig and it would be most practical to divide the private schools into a separate event (or mixed public/private - I don't care really).
