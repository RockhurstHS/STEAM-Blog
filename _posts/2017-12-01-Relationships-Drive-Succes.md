	In March of 2017, Rockhurst High School earned an [AdvancED STEM Certification](https://www.rockhursths.edu/pages/news/news---stem-certification). This achievement certainly puts Rockhurst on the [national map](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2017/03/28/Nationally-Renowned.html).

	So how does a traditional school that has experience a century of success accomplish such an innovative task?

	When the “[STEAM TEAM](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/team/)” was initially formed, a decision was made by Mr. Paul Winkeler, Mr. J.W. Clark, and myself. We were going to meet with every single faculty & staff member one on one. 

	We asked each person three questions:

1. What is your understanding of STEAM?
2. How do you see yourself fitting in?
3. What are your questions and concerns?

<p class="caption">Qualitative alysis revealed which themes were most important for faculty and staff members.</p>

	After taking notes and analyzing the results using some qualitative analysis software, we learned a lot. Our ‘[way of proceeding](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2015/07/30/New-Frontiers.html)’ became clear. Through these conversations, we knew which goals were possible, which would be long term and which objectives would most align with our school’s mission. 

	The interviews gave us a list of a group of ‘small wins’ that we could immediately accomplish. Spending time with each individual person and learning from their perspective was invaluable. The effort established credibility and buy-in that came to fruition with the AdvancED STEM Certification. Narratives of how we demonstrate each of the eleven indicators can be found on our [STEM Certification page](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/stem-certification/). 

	When it comes to moving forward and pursuing the magis, it is crucial to remember the power of the personal connection. It’s not enough to receive support; buy-in and a feeling of co-ownership is the key. As the STEAM initiative looks towards [furthering support the mission of Rockhurst High School](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/vision/), including individuals in a personal way must be part of the best practice repertoire. 
  
  Rockhurst High School will be sharing its success in March of 2018 when it hosts a [regional STEM Conference](http://www.cvent.com/events/advanced-missouri-join-the-journey-spotlighting-stem-conference/event-summary-13ba5e792b784513bac9445992df71a1.aspx?i=12e96583-4378-42d2-add5-ba64cfd07e0a) in partnership with AdvancED. In this way, Rockhurst hopes to model for it students by being a '[School with and for Others](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/10/06/MLTS.html)' and plays its role in helping lift up the educational ecosystem of the community.
