<blockquote>Should we be a "STEAM" school or a "STEM" school? That is the question.</blockquote>

When we sat down at the end of last school year to lay the groundwork for this year's STEM initiative, it was proposed that we should be a STEAM school. I have to admit. The term "STEAM" sounded odd at first. To me, STEM is the more familiar of the two buzz words, one I had seen often in social media that emphasizes the need to fill future STEM jobs with American talent. In fact, it is a matter of national security that we may lose many of our high tech jobs to overseas workers. -->insert stats here<--

The goal is to energize youth interests in STEM fields. The future is projected to offer new STEM jobs at the higher rates of growths than any other field



<blockquote>We put the "A" in STEAM to foster creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit.</blockquote>
