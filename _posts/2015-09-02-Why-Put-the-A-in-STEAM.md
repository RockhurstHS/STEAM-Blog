<blockquote>Should we be a "STEAM" school or a "STEM" school? That is the question.</blockquote>

When we sat down at the end of last school year to lay the groundwork for this year's STEM initiative, it was proposed that we should be a STEAM school. I have to admit. At the time STEAM sounded odd to me. STEM is the more familiar of the two buzz words, one I had seen often in social media emphasizing the importance of energizing youth interest in the STEM fields. The idea is to drive today's youth to acquire skills that are high in demand in the projected future career fields. 



<blockquote>We put the "A" in STEAM to foster creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit.</blockquote>
