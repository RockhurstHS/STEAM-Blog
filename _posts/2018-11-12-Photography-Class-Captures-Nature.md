This semester the photography classes had the opportunity to visit the Kansas City Zoo to work on their skills in nature photography.  This was a chance for the students to experience a Kansas City treasure and learn about many of God’s creatures, some that were familiar and some that were new.  They could also practice using different styles of lenses.  Below are a few of their images and reflections of the experience.

On Monday, September 24, we traveled beyond the Rockhurst atmosphere to the Kansas City Zoo in order to take pictures in a more natural environment. When our group arrived, Nick Rowe, Max Lovick, and I decided to go away from the crowd and move left towards Australia first. While we were in going to Australia, I photographed animals such as the Bengal Tiger, Macaw, and my personal favorite, the kangaroo. I loved the kangaroo exhibit because of the open area. I was able to observe them without a cage or netting, but instead an open field. I stepped just a bit off of the path to get a better angle, and I was able to capture some good photos.

The day was very cloudy, humid, and not too hot. However, I was expecting weather more on the chilly side so I wore pants and a sweatshirt, but man was I wrong to do that. I felt myself having to constantly wipe my face to try and prevent moisture of any kind on the camera. Aside from my own dumb mistake, I did not face any problems both at the zoo in general nor the camera. Because I was constantly going outside and inside, I just set my ISO to auto so that I did not have to keep adjusting it. The trip was so fun, and I’m glad I decided to go instead of writing an essay. I got to miss some class to go look at animals I do not get to see everyday… and eat Dip and Dots (highlight of the trip for sure).
