The first 3D print to arrive at Rockhurst High School. When I heard about it, I had to grab a few photos and share. It's blue. It has eight arms. We call it "Rocktopus." 

<div class="flex-wrapper">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rocktopus01.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/rocktopus02.jpg">
</div>

This was the first test print sent by our robotics faculty and coach, Andy Wilcox. I can't wait to see how the robotics team uses the new 3D printer to fabricate parts and prototypes.
