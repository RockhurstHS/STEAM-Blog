Inspired by the film [Most Likely to Succeed](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/10/06/MLTS.html), I'm piloting a new program aimed at empowering students with psychological tools to help them develop a sense of agency and learn how to make better use of their self-directed time.

<div align="center"> 
<b> Students will participate in three sessions. </b>

### Session 1 

Students will be introduced to a topic, such as Growth Mindset.

### Session 2


Students will develop an action plan with their peers. They will all agree to create a [SMART goal](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php) and decide how they will measure their progress towards that goal in the coming week.


### Session 3


Students will then present their learnings to their fellow peers.


An example presentation from the first pilot is below.

<blockquote> Education isn't confined to just class time, athletic/co-curricular practice time, or retreat time. Learning can occur during self-directed time too. Isn't that what happens in the real world? </blockquote>
