Most recently, students designed and produced stop motion videos! Below is one of the student stop motion videos, followed by his reflection. Enjoy!

LEGO influenced me greatly as I child because they let my creative mind flow. My creative mind now uses filmmaking as a way to crave its hunger. By combining my old ways of creativity with the new I thought I could create an image that would be pretty interesting. The hardest decision for me was to figure out a plot for the video. After an hour or so of brainstorming I came up with an idea that was a balance between easy and difficult. I broke the film down into scenes taking anywhere from 30-100 pictures in a scene. Those scenes lasted anywhere from 3-12 seconds long. I focused on a lot of close up shots to show emotion of my protagonist and antagonist. The editing process might seem painstaking, but I used an old system that makes work for a stop motion really easy. In stop motion, the number one lesson I learned was patience. In order for your stop motion to look really good you have to have patience and take every picture seriously.
