<blockquote>Creating stories is an

Rockhurst has great common core classes in which you can learn a lot in, but more importantly
in my mind there are classes offered, electives, that enrich the mind. Electives put everything
you learn in classes and applies it to one specific type of job or task. Additionally, electives allow
you to explore career opportunities outside of the normal school curriculum. My favorite electives are the film classes.

We get to learn what it means to tell a story in a digital way. I originally enrolled in the class to see the cool equipment, but I have come to a conclusion that
it’s not the equipment that tells the story, it's you, who tells the story. Creating stories is an
aspect of being a man for others because we are able to teach people through a fun and
entertaining environment about what they didn’t know, help them by learning moral value stories
and by inspiring them to be creative.
