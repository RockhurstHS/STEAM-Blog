Reflecting upon my Rockhurst High School experience, a few highlights come to my mind:

 - Playing freshmen football (‘playing’ might be too strong of a word)
 - Competing in the chess room EVERY activity period and EVERYday after school
 - Studying Physics/Playing Nintendo64 Mario Kart for 6+ hours at a friend’s house in order to prepare for a Dr. Campisano exam.
 
The Rockhurst Vision Statement claims to “foster lifelong friendships”.
 
One of projects within the STEAM initiative is the Classroom Redesign.
 
Ultimately, the goal aims to create a more student-centered learning environment emphasizing collaboration – one of the core values of STEAM.
 
 - There will be no ‘front of the classroom’.
 - Flexible furniture provides more autonomy for students.
 - Cutting edge technology empower learning activities.
