On Thursday, January 18th five members of the Rockhurst High School Science department, accompanied by several students participated at the Brookwood Elementary STEM Night. Rockhurst, along with several area institutions, promoted the joys of science and encouraged the young students with their science studies.

The elementary kids were blown away by all the cool science demonstrations that Rockhurst students and teachers shared with them. Mr. Paul Winkeler brough meteorite samples to show the kids; this was a major highlight because they could test their magnetic strength! Every time a coke bottle was sent into the air at Mr. Patrick Doyle’s table, all eyes turned to see; the kids couldn't get enough.

One mother said the following, “I honestly didn't realize how into science my five year old daughter was until we attended STEAM night! Thank you for sending such friendly and professional teachers/students to our school’s event--it helped make for a wonderful evening.”

The Rockhurst High School STEAM Initiative aspires to inspire students from around the community. By being a ‘School for Others’, Rockhurst can further its mission and positively impact the lives of even more students in the community.
