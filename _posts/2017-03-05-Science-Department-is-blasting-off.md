title: Science Department is blasting off!
---

If you havenâ€™t heard, the Science department reached an inflection point and is positively accelerating. 

[And not because the Pope's Astronomer spoke to the entire student body](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/08/17/Pope's-Astronomer.html)

The students in the biology and chemistry classes are experiencing more labs than ever before.

Students in Physics and Robotics are getting more and more hands on.

So if you see a Science teacher, then stop to thank him or her. Not only did they spend a combined 80+ hours cleaning the laboratory glassware this summer or put a [weather station on the roof](http://rhswx.rockhursths.edu/), they continue to increase the number of innovative student offerings at an increasing rate.
