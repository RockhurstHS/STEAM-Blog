If you havenâ€™t heard, the Science department reached an inflection point and is positively accelerating. 

[And not because the Pope's Astronomer spoke to the entire student body](http://steam.rockhursths.edu/2016/08/17/Pope's-Astronomer.html)

The students in the biology and chemistry classes are experiencing more labs than ever before.

And there is even an Outdoor Classroom plan in the works!

Want to get involved in science or engineering outside the classroom? Then there are more opportunities than you may realize.

So if you see a Science teacher, then stop to thank him or her. Not only did they spend a combined 80+ hours cleaning the laboratory glassware this summer or put a [weather station on the roof](http://rhswx.rockhursths.edu/), they continue to increase the number of innovative student offerings at an increasing rate.
