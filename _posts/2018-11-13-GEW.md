On November 12th, 2018, Students from the Entrepreneurship for Othesr class shared the status of their busines canvas at the [Young Entrepreneurs Showcase](https://www.kcsourcelink.com/gew/d/gewkc-2018/young-entrepreneurs-showcase), which was part of the program for Global Entrepreneurship Week. The event was hosted at Westport Plexpod Commons. Over 300 students from the region came to learn about the various student projects. Furthermore, entrepreneurs from all over the region were asking the students questions about their product/service. As the morning progressed, the various groups started competing with each other for which group could procure the most business cards from area entrepreneurs!
